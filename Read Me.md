Project Overview: Descriptive Analysis and Bill Prediction for Hotel Ranga

Situation
Hotel Ranga was aiming to optimize its revenue by understanding its customer segments better and predicting total bills. The goal was to tailor marketing strategies to different customer segments and offer targeted deals to maximize revenue, especially on days with lower customer turnout.

Responsibilities and Actions

1. Data Preprocessing
The initial phase of the project focused on preparing the data for analysis and model building. This involved:

Data Collection: Gathering data from various sources, including booking records, customer demographics, and historical billing information.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies to ensure data quality.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data to improve model performance, such as calculating the average spending per customer and identifying peak booking times.

2. Analysis and Model Training Using PySpark in Databricks
To predict total bills and identify patterns in customer behavior, I utilized PySpark in Databricks for its scalability and efficiency in handling large datasets.

Descriptive Analysis: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and insights. This included visualizing data distributions, correlations, and identifying key drivers of total billing amounts.
Linear Regression Model: Developed a linear regression model to predict total bills based on various features, such as customer demographics, booking details, and seasonal factors. Steps involved:
Splitting Data: Dividing the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Training the linear regression model on the training set.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to ensure accuracy and reliability.

3. Visualization and Dashboard Creation Using Power BI
To enable Hotel Ranga to make data-driven decisions, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard. This involved:

Key Metrics Visualization: Displaying important metrics such as total revenue, average bill per customer, and occupancy rates.

Customer Segmentation: Identifying and visualizing different customer segments based on spending behavior, demographics, and booking patterns.

Revenue Optimization Strategies: Highlighting days with lower customer turnout and suggesting targeted offers to boost revenue. This included visualizing the impact of these strategies on customer turnout and revenue.

Results
The project led to several significant outcomes that contributed to Hotel Ranga's revenue optimization and improved customer experience:

Targeted Marketing Strategies: The insights gained from the analysis enabled the hotel to design and implement targeted marketing strategies. By offering attractive deals on specific days, the hotel could better manage occupancy and maximize revenue.

Increased Customer Turnout: Providing complimentary sweets and drinks on days with fewer customers encouraged more bookings and higher customer satisfaction, leading to increased customer turnout on those days.

Revenue Boost: The combination of predictive modeling and customer segmentation helped Hotel Ranga identify high-value customer segments and tailor their offers accordingly, resulting in a noticeable boost in overall revenue.
Conclusion

The successful implementation of this project demonstrated the power of data analysis and predictive modeling in enhancing business strategies. By leveraging PySpark for efficient data processing and analysis, and Power BI for intuitive visualization, Hotel Ranga could make informed decisions that directly contributed to its revenue growth and customer satisfaction. The project highlighted the importance of data-driven decision-making in the hospitality industry, paving the way for further advancements in revenue management and customer relationship strategies.
